# Design Patterns 1 - Behavioral

My notes from [The Ultimate Design Patterns: Part 1](https://codewithmosh.com/p/design-patterns-part1) course.

## Patterns

1. Memento
   > Allows restoring an object to a previous state.
1. State
   > Allows an object to behave differently depending on the state it is in.
1. Iterator
   > Allows iterating over an object without having to expose the objectâ€™s internal structure (which may change in the future).
1. Strategy
   > Allows passing different algorithms (behaviours) to an object.Allows defining a template (skeleton) for an operation. Specific steps will then be implemented in subclasses.
1. Template Method
1. Command
   > Allows decouple a sender from a receiver. The sender will talk to the receive through a command. Commands can be undone and persisted.
1. Observer
   > Allows an object notify other objects when its state changes.
1. Mediator
   > Allows an object to encapsulate the communication between other objects.
1. Chain of Responsibility
   > Allows building a chain of objects to process a request.
1. Visitor
   > Allows adding new operations to an object structure without modifying it.
